  Chat App is a mobile application on the iPhone that enables users to communicate and chat with each other through text messages, audio, or images. I developed this app for the purpose of learning about iOS.
## Installation Guide:
  ### Using Xcode:
  Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Apple. It provides tools and resources for developing applications for Apple platforms such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
## Technologies Used:
  ### Swift & UIkit:
  Swift is a modern and powerful programming language developed by Apple. It is designed to be easy to read, write, and maintain while providing performance and safety. Swift is used to develop applications across various Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
  UIKit is a framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces in iOS and tvOS applications. It offers a set of pre-built user interface components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and views that developers can use to create attractive and interactive interfaces.
  ### CocoaPods:
  CocoaPods is a library manager for Swift and Objective-C, simplifying the process of installing and updating third-party libraries in iOS projects. It allows developers to easily search, install, and manage popular libraries like Firebase in their projects.
  ### Firebase Realtime Database:
  Firebase Realtime Database is a real-time database service provided by Google. It offers a cloud-based database that allows data synchronization across devices in real-time. Firebase Realtime Database uses the WebSocket protocol to maintain a continuous connection between the app and the database, enabling data to be transmitted quickly and instantly.
  Using Firebase Realtime Database in Chat App creates a real-time communication environment, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly. When a new message is sent from one device, it is instantly updated on all other devices connected to the same database.
